Evercool
========

Imagine yourself on your way home on a hot sunny day.
Wouldn't you wish someone would turn the AC for you ahead of time?

Evercool - an iPhone app that knows when you're on your way home,
checks the weather, and turns on the AC automatically for you at just the right temperature.

It works by having a raspberry pi connected to an IR LED which can control your AC.
