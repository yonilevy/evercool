Evercool
========

Imagine yourself on your way home on a hot sunny day.
Wouldn't you wish someone would turn the AC for you ahead of time?

Evercool - an iPhone app that knows when you're on your way home,
checks the weather, and turns on the AC automatically for you at just the right temperature.

It works by having a raspberry pi connected to an IR LED which can control your AC.


## What we did to get it working

### Connect the IR receiver / transmitter circuit to the breadboard
The first step is to wire the IR receiver / transmitter circuit to your RaspberryPi.
We combined two different schemas on the same circuit to save some time

### Set up your RaspberryPi and configure LIRC
#### Configure the LIRC module
You'll need to add the following lines to your /etc/modules file -
```
lirc_dev
lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22
```

You'll also need to setup hardware.conf and some other stuff, for more information you can check the link below

(This assumes the used GPIO ports are 23 and 22, taken from http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/06/setting-up-lirc-on-the-raspberrypi/)

#### Record the IR signal from the remote
After setting up the circuit and configuring LIRC we'll now need to record the IR signal from the remote control.
Basically the IR signal is just a pulsing light that pulses at different intervals to encode data, the recording process just digitizes these pulses into a configuration file.

After running 
```
irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 ~/lircd.conf
```
The result lircd.conf should look like this -
```

      end raw_codes

end remote
```
(This is the actual configuration file we used in the demo)
#### Testing the transmitter
After copying the result lircd.conf to the right place and restarting the lirc daemon you can test that everything works by running
```
irsend SEND_ONCE BTN_0
````

If everything worked you should get a working ventilator :) woohoo! If something went bad we highly recommend that you follow the guides we referenced, they are more than enough to get everything working.

### iOS Client
#### Geo-fencing
We've used geo-fencing to set and detect entrance to the user "home location".
Apple provides pretty straight-forward APIs for doing this, we used the following classes to get everything up -
* MKMapView - Displaying and selecting the home location
* CLLocationManager - for the actual geographical region changes
* UIApplication / presentLocalNotificationNow - for showing local push notifications to the user
* NSURLConnection - for server side communication and the actual control the the RaspberryPi
* Yahoo weather for local temperature measurement and thresholding

You can always look at the source code if you have any questions on the actual implementation :)

### Server Side
#### Heroku Flusk / Gunicorn application
We've chosen the combination of Flusk & Gunicorn deployed on heroku for the server side.
The server is pretty simple - the RaspberryPi polls the server every second for commands, the iOS client updates the server when the AC/Fan needs to start or stop.


## That's it!
